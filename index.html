                    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words

                <p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there 
                    isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
                    All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as 
                    necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a 
                    dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence 
                    structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated 
                    Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or 
                    non-characteristic words etc. is reproduced below for those interested. 
                    Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also

                <p>BDSM is a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, 
                    discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal 
                    dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people 
                    who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or 
                    subculture is usually dependent upon self-identification and shared experience.
                    The BDSM initialism.
                    The term "BDSM" is first recorded in a Usenet posting from 1991,[1] and is interpreted
                     as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and 
                     submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase 
                     covering a wide range of activities, forms of interpersonal relationships, and distinct 
                     subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who 
                     identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers, body modification 
                     enthusiasts, animal roleplayers, rubber fetishists, and others.
                    Activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the 
                    participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of informed 
                    consent of both the partners is essential. The terms "submissive" and "dominant" are 
                    often used to distinguish these roles: the dominant partner ("dom") takes psychological 
                    control over the submissive ("sub"). The terms "top" and "bottom" are also used: the 
                    top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action. 
                    The two sets of terms are subtly different: for example, someone may choose to act 
                    as bottom to another person, for example, by being whipped, purely recreationally, 
                    without any implication of being psychologically dominated by them, or a submissive 
                    may be ordered to massage their dominant partner. Despite the bottom performing the 
                    action and the top receiving they have not necessarily switched roles.</p>
