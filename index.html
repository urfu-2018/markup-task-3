                            WASHINGTON — The Trump
                            administration, confronted with
                            further evidence of a cover-up in
                            the killing of the journalist Jamal

                            defending the value of its
                            alliance with Saudi Arabia and
                            pressing the Saudi government
                            for answers.

                            The White House sent the director
                            of the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, to Istanbul
                            to help the Turkish government
                            with its investigation into
                            the killing, according to an official.
                            But in Riyadh, Treasury Secretary
                            Steven Mnuchin held a wide-ranging
                            meeting with Saudi Arabia’s
                            crown prince, Mohammed bin
                            Salman, who is suspected of playing
                            a role in the killing of Mr.
                            Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident.

                            Saudi Consulate in Istanbul,
                            traded views with Prince Mohammed
                            on economic ties and counterterrorism
                            initiatives, as well as

                            Treasury Department spokesman.
                            There are also fresh doubts
                            about the Saudi government’s
                            claim that Mr. Khashoggi was
                            strangled accidentally after he got
                            into a fist fight with 15 Saudi operatives,
                            with video of a body double
                            surfacing on Monday. A Saudi operative
                            donned Mr. Khashoggi’s

                        TUCSON — The Trump administration,
                        facing a surge in migrant
                        families entering the United
                        States, is moving swiftly to examine
                        an array of new policies it
                        hopes will deter Central Americans
                        from journeying north.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each of the policies, which
                        range from a new form of the
                        widely criticized practice of family
                        separation to stricter requirements
                        on asylum, would face significant
                        legal and logistical challenges.
                        But the White House is applying
                        strong pressure on federal
                        immigration authorities to come
                        up with a solution to secure the
                        southwest border.

                        The Border Patrol apprehended
                        16,658 people in family units in
                        September — a record figure, according
                        to unpublished government
                        data obtained by The New
                        York Times. The total number of
                        families that entered the country
                        in the 2018 fiscal year, which
                        ended Sept. 30, exceeded 100,000
                        for the first time in recent history.
                        The surge is occurring even as
                        the total number of border crossings,
                        including individual adults
                        and children traveling alone, remains
                        well below the numbers
                        seen in the late 1990s and early
                        2000s.

                        President Trump’s frustration
                        was aroused again this week with
                        the news that a caravan of thousands
                        of Central American asylum
                        seekers was headed toward
                        the United States. He threatened
                        on Twitter to call up the military
                        and close the southern border if
                        Mexico failed to halt the “onslaught”
                        of migrants.

                        Department of Homeland Security,

                        White House and the State Department
                        began not long after a
                        public outcry forced President
                        Trump in June to stop separating
                        migrant families in detention, often
                        hundreds or thousands of miles apart,
                        as a deterrent.

                    <p>
                        President Trump on Monday
                        sharply intensified a Republican
                        campaign to frame the midterm
                        elections as a battle over immigration
                        and race, issuing a dark and
                        factually baseless warning that
                        “unknown Middle Easterners”
                        were marching toward the American
                        border with Mexico.

                        The unsubstantiated charge
                        was an escalation of Mr. Trump’s
                        efforts to stoke fears about foreigners
                        and crime ahead of the
                        Nov. 6 vote, as he did to great effect
                        in the presidential race. Mr.
                        Trump and other Republicans are
                        insistently seeking to tie Democrats
                        to unfettered immigration
                        and violent crime, and in some instances
                        this summer and fall they
                        have attacked minority candidates
                        in nakedly racial terms.

                    <p>
                        Mr. Trump is now railing daily

                        against the migrant caravan moving
                        north through Central America,
                        and on Monday called it a national
                        emergency. The caravan
                        has dominated conservative talk
                        radio and Fox News, where there
                        has also been loose speculation
                        about a link to terrorism. The apparently
                        groundless inclusion of
                        “unknown Middle Easterners” to
                        the caravan echoes Mr. Trump’s
                        longstanding practice of amplifying
                        fears about Islamic militants
                        on the campaign trail.

                        “That is an assault on our country
                        and in that caravan you have
                        some very bad people and we
                        can’t let that happen to our country,”
                        the president said at a rally in
                        Houston on Monday night. Mr.
                        Trump suggested without any
                        proof that the opposition was involved
                        in instigating the caravan.
                        “I think the Democrats had something
                        to do with it,” he said.

                        In targeting the caravan, the
                        president appears determined to
                        end the election season with a cultural
                        fight over national identity
                        rather than the issues that party
                        leaders initially wanted to run on,
