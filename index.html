                            Niels Bohr (1885-1962) Danish physicist.  Professor Niels Bohr, a famous
                            Applied Mathematician-Physicist, had a horse shoe over his desk.  One day a
                            student asked if he really believed that a horse shoe brought luck.
                            Professor Bohr replied, "I understand that it brings you luck if you
                            believe in it or not."

                            In his later days, Niels Bohr designed a remarkable way to avoid difficult
                            questions.  When somebody was driving him into a corner during a coloquium
                            or lecture, he took a matchbox, apparently to light is cooled pipe, but in
                            fact (as experienced listeners already knew) to drop the inside on the
                            floor.  Afterward he took his time to gather the stick and continued with a
                            talk, about which nobody, least of all the questioner, remembered if it had
                            anything to do with the question.

                            (?) of quantum physics" a charming story about Dirac: When Dirac was
                            visiting Wigner, he saw --- as I recall it was Wigner's sister whom he
                            wound up marrying --- Wigner's sister knitting.  After he left, he came
                            back, and picking up the needles said there is one and only one other
                            variation on this.  Whereby he unknowingly proceeded to demonstrate
                            earling!

                            came to him and said: "The questions of this year's exam are the same as
                            last years!"  "True," Einstein said, "but this year all answers are
                            different."

                    In 1993, two papers reported observations of an astronomical phenomenon called
                    gravitational microlensing. The results showed that microlensing could be used to
                    probe the elusive dark matter that is thought to pervade the Universe.

                            Gravitational microlensing. In 1993, Alcock et al.4 and Aubourg et al.5
                            presented possible evidence for astronomical bodies called massive compact halo
                            objects (MACHOs). Such bodies could account for dark matter — the ‘missing’
                            matter in the Universe. A MACHO can be detected when it passes in front of a star
                            in a nearby galaxy. The MACHO bends light from the star towards Earth, which
                            temporarily amplifies the star’s observed brightness. This effect is known as
                            gravitational microlensing.

                    One of the biggest mysteries in astronomy is the nature of dark matter, which is thought
                    to account for about 85% of the matter and 25% of the total energy in the Universe1.
                    There are several strong pieces of evidence for dark matter2. In particular, spiral
                    galaxies such as the Milky Way have flat rotation curves3 — graphs that show the orbital
                    speed of stars as a function of their distance from the galactic centre. This property
                    indicates that spiral galaxies are surrounded by large quantities of unseen matter. Dark
                    matter has not yet been detected directly, so its identity is still unknown. But 25 years
                    ago, Alcock et al.4 and Aubourg et al.5 reported observations in Nature that paved the
                    way to a better understanding of its properties.

                    In 1986, the Polish astronomer Bohdan Paczyński suggested an observational test6 to
                    determine whether dark matter present in the halo of our Galaxy is composed of
                    astronomical bodies such as small stars, brown dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes. Such
                    bodies are intrinsically faint and would therefore be difficult to see in the Galactic
                    halo from Earth.

                    According to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, these massive compact halo objects
                    (MACHOs) could act as lenses, focusing light and amplifying the observed brightness of
                    stars in nearby galaxies (Fig. 1). This phenomenon, called gravitational microlensing, is
                    sensitive to even low-mass lenses. Paczyński therefore proposed that, by monitoring stars
                    in nearby galaxies, astronomers could look for microlensing events and verify whether
                    MACHOs can account for dark matter.

                    <br>

                    Conceptually, this test is simple. But in practice, it requires millions of stars to be
                    monitored over a period of years. The reason is that the microlensing events have an
                    extremely low probability of being detected, because the star, the MACHO and the observer
                    all need to be aligned. At that time, it was a challenge to observe such a huge number of
                    stars, accurately measure their brightness and analyse the resulting data.

                    In October 1993, Alcock et al. and Aubourg et al. independently announced the first
                    candidates for microlensing events caused by dark objects in the Galactic halo. Alcock
                    and colleagues used a dedicated 1.27-metre-diameter telescope. The telescope was equipped
                    with two charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras that had a field of view of 0.5 square
                    degrees, which was considered large at that time. The authors spent a year monitoring 1.8
                    million stars in a nearby galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud, and discovered one
                    microlensing candidate. By contrast, Aubourg and colleagues used photographic plates that
                    had a field of view of about 25 square degrees. They monitored 3 million stars in the
                    Large Magellanic Cloud for more than three years, and detected two microlensing
                    candidates.
