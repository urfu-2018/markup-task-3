                    <h1>Russians have been cheating the 1987 nuclear treaty for years</h1>
                    <p>
                        Us intelligence first suspected Moscow of developing a ground-based nuclear-armed
                        cruise
                        missile in breach of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty ten years ago.
                        The discovery provoked a confrontation with the Russians that endured during the
                        Obama
                        administration and generated growing alarm in Nato as the new weapon would directly
                        threaten Europe.
                        It was only last year that the US put a name to the missile in question: the
                        land-based
                        Novator 9M729 (designated by Nato as SSC-8), a cruise missile that western
                        intelligence
                        agencies insisted had a range that breached the INF treaty.
                        The 1987 treaty, which eliminated a class of nuclear missiles, set range limits of
                        between 500km (310 miles) and 5,500km (3,418 miles).

                        of confusion.

                    <h1>Gambler who stole €1.7m says bookies must stop playing dumb</h1>
                    <p>
                        A worker who stole €1.75 million from An Post to feed his betting habit has said that
                        not
                        enough is being done to check where addicted gamblers are getting their funds.
                        Tony O’Reilly, from Co Carlow, was jailed for four years with one year suspended in
                        late
                        2012. His Paddy Power account, under the name Tony 10, had a turnover of €10 million.
                        He
                        is now working as an addiction counsellor with a company that aims to reduce the harm
                        caused by gambling.
                        O’Reilly said that bookmakers were not protecting their customers and that there were
                        not
                        enough checks against money laundering. He was speaking after Paddy Power Betfair was
                        fined £2.2 million (€2.5 million) in the UK last week for failing to deal with.
