                        the most successful trilogies ever.

                        When teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is blasted to 1955 in the DeLorean 
                        time machine created by the eccentric Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), he finds 
                        himself mixed up in a time-altering chain reaction that could vaporize his future 
                        — and leave him trapped in the past. Powered by innovative special effects, 
                        unforgettable songs and non-stop action, Back to the Future is an unrivaled 
                        adventure that stands the test of time!

                        Getting back was only the beginning as the most spectacular time-travel

                        proves that lightning can strike twice!

                        Picking up precisely where they left off, Marty and Doc (Michael J. Fox 
                        and Christopher Lloyd) launch themselves to the year 2015 to fine-tune 
                        the future and inadvertently disrupt the space-time continuum. Now, 
                        their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 
                        all over again before it is too late.

                    Back to the Future is a 1985 American science fiction film directed 
                    by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. It stars 
                    Michael J. Fox as teenager Marty McFly, who accidentally travels 
                    back in time to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes 
                    his mother"s romantic interest. Christopher Lloyd portrays the 
                    eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown, inventor of the time-traveling
                    DeLorean, who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985.

                    Zemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale wondered whether he 
                    would have befriended his father if they had attended school together. 
                    Film studios rejected it until the financial success of Zemeckis" 
                    Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to 
                    produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as
                    distributor. Fox was the first choice to play Marty, but he was busy 
                    filming his television series Family Ties, and Eric Stoltz was cast; 
                    after the filmmakers decided he was wrong for the role, a deal was struck 
                    to allow Fox to film Back to the Future without interrupting his 
                    television schedule.
