            Dallas television station KDFW reported Friday that 34-year-old Nathaniel Mitchell
            was arrested by Grand Prairie police after Donna Alexander was hospitalized with
            severe head injuries.
            Police say Mitchell was arrested Sept. 21 and charged with aggravated assault, but that charge
            was upgraded to murder when Alexander died from her injuries Sept. 24. Mitchell is being
            held at the Tarrant County jail without bond. Alexander in 2011 started the Anger Room,
            where customers wear protective equipment and smash printers, televisions and other items.
            A vigil is planned for Alexander on monday night in Cole Park in Dallas.

            A husband who regularly beat his wife and kept her locked indoors
            during their 16-year marriage has been jailed. Aziz Rehman, 47, would only allow
            partner Zeenit Bibi to leave their home in Collingbourne Avenue, Hodge Hill,
            Birmingham when on the school run. He would wedge twigs in the front door
            whenever he went out so he could tell if she had left the house.
            Rehman was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday to three
            years and nine months in prison.
            A jury found the businessman guilty in May of assault and coercive control.
            Mrs Bibi, 36, who married Rehman in December 2000, told the BBC
            she wanted other victims to speak out.
            <em class="quotes">'I didn't think anybody was going to believe me,
                which was one of the reasons that
            I left it so long, because in the outside world he made it
                look like we were the perfect family,'</em>
            - she said.

            The English bulldog is now so inbred that there is little chance of improving its notoriously
            poor health, geneticists have concluded. The lead researcher
            of a study condemned dog breeders and owners,
            saying more people appeared to be “enamoured with its appearance than concerned about its health”.
            English bulldogs suffer from a range of horrendous health problems.
            Its excessive wrinkles are prone to infection unless they are regularly cleaned.
            The dog also has breathing problems due to its narrow nostrils and a number of eye conditions
            that cause chronic irritation and pain. Its deformed spinal bones
            that can also lead to incontinence
            and the loss of the use of its back legs.

        'Anyway, how is your sex life?'
    </h2>
        <div class="a std">
            More than one in four British women report being unhappy with
            their sex lives, new research has found.
            The survey by Public Health England (PHE) of more than 7,300 women investigated problems
            relating to reproductive health and included an unsatisfactory sex life within this umbrella.
            The report revealed that those aged 25 to 34 were the least satisfied in bed,
            with 49 per cent complaining of a lack of sexual enjoyment.
            Dissatisfaction was slightly lower for women aged 55 to 64, less than a third
            of whom reported experiencing unfulfilled sex lives - however, it was not clear whether this
            was because they were enjoying sex more or simply having less sex.
